1. true or false
1. equality operators (==), (!=) relational operators ( < ), ( <= ), ( > ), ( >= ) logical operators (&&), (||), Not
they are operators that perform a caluclation whose result is either true or false
1. Sometimes, it is not necessary to evaluate both operands when ascertaining the result of a conditional logical expression.
1. if the left operand of the && operator evaluates to false, the result of the entire expression must be false,regardless of the value of the right operand. if the value of the left operand of the || operator evaluates to true, the result of the entire expression must be true
1. (), =
1. it defines the statements for if or else. (multiple lines in a statement) 
1. without break the program continues to the next labeled statement, executing the statements until a break or the end of the statement is reached.
1. switch- signals the compiler to perfom a switch statement
	case- label to compare the expressions, each value is called a case
	break- the switch terminates. no break the flow of control will fall through 
	default- executed if no case constant-expression value is equal to the value of expression.
1. they both return eventually the same thing. first recursion takes up more memory. recurr1 has to unwind recurr2 does not have to unwimd. (tail recursion) 
1. a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
